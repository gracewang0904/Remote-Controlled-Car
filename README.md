# Remote-Controlled-Car 🚗

This repository documents the design and development process of a **Remote-Controlled Car** project focused on integrating hardware control with software logic. The source code for control logic and firmware is stored in a separate private repository for security and maintainability purposes.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This RC car combines real-time control with intelligent behavior using a microcontroller and a wireless interface. The project includes:
- Motor control system
- Remote wireless communication (Bluetooth / Wi-Fi)
- Embedded programming
- Sensor integration (e.g. obstacle detection)

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- **Hardware:** Arduino / ESP32 / Raspberry Pi (based on configuration)
- **Languages:** C / C++ / MicroPython
- **Communication:** Bluetooth / Wi-Fi
- **Sensors:** Ultrasonic, Infrared (optional)

## 📁 Repository Structure
